From The World Health Organization: "Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans." "Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death." A potential strategic investor engaged with KALY regarding the companys recently announced consolidation of its business structure to focus on its Cannabis Biopharmaceutical Technology is coordinating with KALY management to facilitate a potential research liaison with organizations addressing the current coronavirus outbreak.
