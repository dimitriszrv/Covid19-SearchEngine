 - It is for governments to decide whether to evacuate their nationals from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and senior Chinese officials discussed measures at talks in Beijing this week, including possible alternatives to evacuation of foreigners "if there are ways to accommodate them and protect their health", WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told Reuters. "If countries want to evacuate their nationals from Wuhan, WHOs position is that this is a matter for their governments to decide," Jasarevic said by email in answer to a query.
