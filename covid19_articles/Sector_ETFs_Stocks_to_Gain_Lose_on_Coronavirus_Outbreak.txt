Global markets turned wobbly at the outbreak of the deadly SARS-like coronavirus in China. Authorities in China reported on Monday that 139 new cases of coronavirus had been found over the weekend, according to Reuters. The disease has taken 9 lives in China to date. With the Lunar New Year on Jan 25, fears of the spread of the disease have grown as millions of people will be traveling to and from China during this weened. To make matters worse, the United States has already confirmed its first case of coronavirus. Asian stocks were hit hard as travel and commerce would get disrupted owing to the threat. Global markets took the cues and slumped in recent trading. Below we highlight a few ETF areas and stocks that could gain/lose from this outbreak. Losers Airlines No wonder, the event is likely to disrupt global air travel. U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS fell about 3% on Jan 21 with United Airlines Holdings, Inc. UAL shedding about 4.4%. American Airlines Group Inc. AAL and Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL were off 4.2% and 2.7% on the day, respectively. Chinese airlines stocks like Air China and China Eastern were also hit hard.
