By Yi Wei Wong Shares of Hong Kong-listed Macau casino operators dived on Wednesday as the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus hits tourism to the Chinese gambling enclave. In early morning trade, Sands China fell 5.7% and Galaxy Entertainment Group shed 5.3%. MGM China is down 5.4% and Melco International Development shed 4.6%. SJM Holding fell 3.8%. The Chinese government has temporarily halted a scheme that was introduced in 2003 to boost tourism to both Hong Kong and Macau following the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, another coronavirus. The individual visit program accounts for around 47% of Macaus visitors. In recent days, Macau has barred visitors from Hubei province, where the new coronavirus originated, and banned package tours from China to stem the spread of the virus. JP Morgan said in a research note that without the package tours, the only option for mainland travellers is to make use of transit, business or family visas, which can be more difficult to obtain. The investment bank said Macau casino stocks have corrected by 13% in the past week, and that daily  visitor numbers to the gaming destination have more than halved since the second day of the Chinese New Year holiday period.
