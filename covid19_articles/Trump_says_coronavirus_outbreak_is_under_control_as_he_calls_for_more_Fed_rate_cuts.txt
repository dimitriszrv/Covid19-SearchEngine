President Donald Trump said the U.S. has the outbreak of the coronavirus under control and has been briefed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Speaking to CNBC, Trump said he wasnt worried it would turn into a pandemic and said the only person infected had flown in from China. He repeated his view that the impeachment is a 'hoax.' Trump batted away a question on whether the Feds balance sheet was the prime reason for the stock-market SPX, +2.64% gains. He said Fed interest rates should still go lower because the dollar DXY, -0.19% is strong.
