The Trump administration is reportedly considering a temporary ban on all flights from China to the U.S. in response the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak. CNBC reported late Tuesday that White House officials reportedly held a conference call with airline officials Tuesday and said a suspension of all China-U.S. flights is on the table as an option. CNBC reported that was one of a variety of responses being considered. 'In terms of travel restrictions . . . it's important to not take anything off the table with a rapidly emerging novel infectious disease,' Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said earlier Tuesday at a press conference. On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department warned travelers to 'reconsider' travelling anywhere in China amid the outbreak, which has sickened at least 6,00 people and killed more than 130 . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also expanded screening for the virus to 20 U.S. airports, up from five. United Airlines UAL, +7.23% said Tuesday it was cancelling dozens of flights to Hong Kong and mainland China, and Delta Air Lines DAL, +6.31% and American Airlines AAL, +7.59% said they will waive fees to allow travelers to reschedule trips to China.
