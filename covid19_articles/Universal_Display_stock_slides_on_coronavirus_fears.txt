Universal Display Corp. shares OLED, -1.16% are off more than 6% in Monday trading after an analyst flagged it as a company that could be 'adversely affected' by the coronavirus crisis. 'We estimate ~1/3 of Chinas total OLED manufacturing capacity is located in Hubei province, including its capital city, Wuhan,' Susquehannas Mehdi Hosseini said in a note to clients. 'Emitter is the key material used in the manufacturing of OLED displays. Universal Display is the key supplier here, which could be adversely impacted by the inability to ship products to Wuhan.' Hosseini also wrote that Western Digital Corp. WDC, +3.66% could actually see positive short-term impacts from the disruption as Chinas Yangtze Memory Tech Co. is based in Wuhan and manufacturing issues there could lead to 'tighter' NAND supply. However, Western Digital shares are being punished in Mondays session along with chip stocks more broadly. The stock is off 4.6% while the PHLX Semiconductor index SOX, -0.67% is down 3.7%. The S&P 500 SPX, -0.56% is down 1.5%.
