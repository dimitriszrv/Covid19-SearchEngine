To gauge the effect of the quickly spreading coronavirus on the companies we cover, we look back at SARS. A coronavirus that originated in China is spreading quickly, with more than 900 cases reported worldwide and at least 26 deaths as of Jan. 24. Though most are in mainland China, cases have been confirmed in Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, Japan, and the United States, disrupting travel and forcing officials to quarantine cities--more than 30 million people in China are under travel restrictions. Among the companies we cover, those in the travel and tourism industries are the most likely to be affected by the outbreak: airlines and airports, casinos, resorts, online travel agencies. Wynn Macau's chief executive didn't rule out closing casinos if the outbreak worsens, for example. Chelsey Tam does not own shares in any of the securities mentioned above.
