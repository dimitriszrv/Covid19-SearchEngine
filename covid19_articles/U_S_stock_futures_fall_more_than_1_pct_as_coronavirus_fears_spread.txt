 - U.S. S&P500 e-mini futures fell more than 1% in Asian trade on Monday on mounting worries the new coronavirus outbreak could severely disrupt the Chinese economy, an engine of global growth. Chinas cabinet said it would extend the week-long Lunar New Year holiday by three days to Feb. 2 and Hong Kong banned residents of Chinas Hubei province, where the new coronavirus outbreak was first reported, from entering the city.
