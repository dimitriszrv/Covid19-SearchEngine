The outbreak of a new coronavirus has spread to more Chinese cities, including Shanghai and the capital Beijing, authorities said on Monday. "Concerns over the spread of the virus is affecting market sentiments. Unfortunately, its coming at a bad time because its the travel season in China ahead of the New Year celebrations," said Linus Loo, head of research at Lim & Tan Securities. Losses in the banking and industrial sectors weighed on the city-states benchmark as it fell to its lowest in nearly two weeks. Lender DBS Group Holdings lost nearly 1%, while conglomerate Jardine Strategic Holdings was down over 2%. Philippine shares were dragged down by heavy losses in the financial sector, with conglomerate Ayala Corp and real estate developer Ayala Land shedding 5.1% and 2.8% respectively. Regulatory scrutiny on certain projects related to the Ayala group had led to "possible regulatory risks involved in private sectors contracts with the government," Rachelle Cruz, analyst at AP Securities said. Foreign investors seem to have concerns about other companies that have similar contracts, and the possibility of probes into such contracts, Cruz added. President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday said he would review a government rail transit contract https://www.manilatimes.net/2020/01/19/news/headlines/duterte-to-review-lrt-contract-next/675652 with Ayala and Metro Pacific Investment Corp, while the presidential spokesperson had separately hinted at investigations into an Ayala IT park https://www.manilatimes.net/2020/01/20/news/top-stories/palace-isnt-done-with-ayala-targets-technohub/675908, on Sunday, The Manila Times reported. Thai stocks were also lower, hurt by losses in the industrial and utility sectors. Airport operator Airports of Thailand PCL dropped 3.7%, while chemical maker PTT Global Chemical PCL plunged 6%.
