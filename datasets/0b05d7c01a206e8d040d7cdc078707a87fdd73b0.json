The features are grouped into various categories to account for their impact based on the higher-level concepts associated with them. This work uses several correlation analysis techniques to observe value and order relationships between features, feature groups, and COVID-19 occurrences. Dimensionality reduction techniques and projection methodologies are used to elaborate on individual and group contribution of these informative features to the representation variance. In addition, a specific RNN-based inference pipeline called DoubleWindowLSTM-CP is designed in this work for predictive event modeling with minimal use of historical data on outbreak events, thus utilizing sequential and temporal patterns as well as enabling concise record representation.",

The family of Coronaviruses to which this RNA virus belongs can cause respiratory tract infections of various severities. These infections range from cases of the common cold to the more lethal degrees. Many of the confirmed cases and deaths reported due to COVID-19 showed evidence of severe forms of the aforementioned infections [1] , [2] , [3] .

The idea is to provide a reliable source of information derived from a wide range of sources on important features describing a region and its population from various perspectives. These features primarily have to do with demographics, socio-economic, and public health aspects of the US regions. They are chosen in this manner because it is plausible to assume that they can be potential indicators of commonalities between the affected areas. Even though finding causality is not the objective of this work, our analyses attempt to shed light on these possible commonalities that allow public health researchers to obtain a better perspective on the nature of this pandemic and the potential factors contributing to a slower outbreak. This is vitally important as the critical role of proper policies enforced at the proper time is evident now more than ever.",

Accordingly, we present a neural architecture with recurrent neural networks in its core to allow the machine to learn to predict pandemic events in the near future, given a short window of historical information on static and dynamic regional features. The main assumption that this work attempts to empirically validate is that the concise arXiv:2008.07342v1 [cs.CY] 8 Aug 2020 pandemic-related region-based representations can be learned and leveraged to obtain accurate outbreak event prediction with only minimal use of the historical information related to the outbreak. Aside from the theoretical importance, an essential application of this framework is when the reported historical pandemic information, e.g., number of cases, is not reliable. An example of this is when a region discovers a problem in its reporting scheme that makes the historical information on the pandemic inaccurate due to overestimation or underestimation. Such unreliability will severely affect the models which use this historical information as the core of their analysis.",

This work is distinguished from the mentioned projects and the majority of statistical works in this area in the sense that it is targeting the role of region-based features in the Spatio-temporal analysis of the pandemic with minimal use of historical data on the outbreak events. The area unit of this work is US county which enables a more fine-grained prediction scheme compared to the other works that have mostly targeted the state-level analytics. To our best knowledge, the works in [16] and [21] are the only attempts in county-level modeling of the disease dynamics. In [16] , authors have proposed a non-parametric model for epidemic data that incorporates area-level characteristics in the SIR model. The work in [21] uses a combination of iterated filtering and the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman filter for tuning their model, and their approach is based on a county-level SEIR model. The empirical results show that our approach outperforms these models on the evaluation benchmarks while providing a framework for utilizing deep learning in analysis and modeling the short-term pandemic events.

A primary and essential step in doing so is to prepare a dataset covering a wide range of information topics, from socio-economic to regional mobility reports. More details regarding the primary data sources from which we have obtained information for this work's dataset are elaborated upon hereunder. 1) COVID-19 Daily Information per County: Our first step towards the mentioned objective is to gather the daily COVID-19 outbreak data. This data should include the number of cases that are confirmed to be caused by the novel coronavirus and its associated death toll. We are using the publicly accessible dataset API in [8] , [9] to fetch the relevant data records. The table of data obtained using this API contains the numerical information along with dates corresponding to each record, and each document includes the number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths that occurred due to COVID-19 on that date. It also includes the number of recoveries from COVID-19 in the same format. This dataset's significance is that it provides us with a detailed and high-resolution temporal trajectory of the COVID-19 outbreak in different urban regions across the United States. Using the dates, one can constitute a set of time-series for every county and monitor the outbreak along with the other metadata to make relevant inferences.",

To draw meaning from the data that we have at hand, we have designed and utilized a variety of techniques. These methodologies range from traditional statistical methodologies to the design and testing of deep learning inference pipelines for event prediction. We select a set of representative features to use in our analytics from the gathered collection of datasets. More details on the nature of these features are shown in Table I. 16) Feature Informativeness for Sub-region Representation: An important question that is raised in analyzing a dataset with well-defined categories of features is how important these features are in describing the entities associated with them. From the particular perspective of enabling the differentiation between two regions, it can be said that a measure of importance is the contribution of each one of these selected features to the overall variation in datapoints. The boundary case is that if a feature always has the same value, it is not informative as there is no entropy value associated with its distribution. To begin with, we associate a mathematical vector with each data point, which contains the values of all its dynamic and static features associated with a specific date and location. Since we are mainly targeting US counties in this study, each record would be associated with a US county at a specific date. We then use Linear Principal Component Analysis [36] to reduce the dimensionality of these data points and to evaluate the importance of the selected features in terms of their contribution to the overall variation. Results show that in order to retain over 98% of the original variance, a minimum of 55 principal components should be considered. Each one of these components is found as a linear combination of the original set of features, and that along with II  THE EQUATIONS FOR THE THREE MAIN CORRELATION ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES USED IN THIS WORK, NAMELY ",

We have considered four principal measures of correlation, namely: Pearson, Kendall, Histogram Intersection, and Spearman, as described in Table II . We have used the Pearson correlation coefficient along with the p-values to shed light on the presence or absence of a significant relationship between the values of each specific feature and each category of pandemic outcome. We have also computed nonparametric Spearman rank correlation coefficients between any two of our random variables. This value would be computed as the Pearson measure of the raw values converted to their ranks. The formulation is shown in Table II in which d i is the difference in paired ranks. Mutual information has also been used to provide additional information on such relationships. This coefficient measures the strength of the association between the values of these random variables in terms of their ranks. Since many of the relationships in our dataset can be intuitively thought of as monotonic, these values are particularly important. To better understand the concordance and discordance, Kendall correlation is computed as well. In the formulation shown in Table II , m 1 and m 2 are the numbers of concordant and discordant pairs of values, respectively. Normalized Histogram Intersection is another methodology directly targeting the distributions of these variables.

The static features include various socio-economic and demographical properties associated with a region and its population. Combined with the dynamic set of features such as influenza activity level and mobility patterns, this information was leveraged along with a short track of pandemic time-series for predictive modeling. We do not claim that the data points coming from this domain are statistically sufficient for the pandemic event prediction tasks; however, empirical results indicate that they can be effectively utilized for these objectives. There are occurrences outside of this domain that can impact the outcomes (e.g., the initial impact of a large number of infected people arriving in a specific location is not initially captured by our scheme). Nevertheless, the results indicate that the data points coming solely from this work's domain can help in the effective knowledge extraction regarding the current and future values of pandemic-related time-series.

We have used statistical analysis techniques to investigate the relationships between individual features and the epidemic, while also considering the contribution of such features to the overall representation power. We have also proposed a deep learning framework to validate this idea that such region-based representations can be leveraged to obtain accurate predictions of the epidemic trajectories while using but a minimal amount of historical data on the outbreak events (e.g., number of cases). Even though are model is trained with the objective of providing county-level predictions, we have aggregated these county-level predictions and used these now state-level estimators to evaluate the loss on the most recent data. In Table 6 , we have compared these results with the information on the similar performance measure of the eight COVID-19 prediction works that perform state-level inference making.

The results indicate that in terms of quantitative assessment, the lack of presence for the highly affected areas causes a significant drop in the loss values. However, the qualitative analysis showed that the models do not perform well in the case of rising values, as the amount of information available on such cases to train the network on is fairly limited. This causes both family of models to be biased in making predictions that tend to underestimate the target values. ",
