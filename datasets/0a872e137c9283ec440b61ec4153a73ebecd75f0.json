Though all nations of the world have been affected by this disease, there have been marked cross-national variations in prevalence, severity and mortality rates. Various explanations, based on demographic, social and climatic factors, have been suggested to account for this variability, but these remain unverified to date. Based on recent research findings suggesting that human enterocytes may serve as a point of entry for SARS-CoV-2, leading to intestinal viral replication, this paper puts forward the hypothesis that prior intestinal infection with coronaviruses, either symptomatic or asymptomatic, may moderate this process and minimize the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This hypothesis is supported by evidence on the gastrointestinal manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and related infections, on the geographical patterns observed in the variability of COVID-19 mortality, and on the occurrence and geographical distribution of outbreaks of diarrheal disease, as well as asymptomatic infection, with human coronaviruses as verified by direct or serological testing. Preliminary supporting evidence based on national and international health statistics is presented, along with suggestions on more robust methods by which this hypothesis may be tested. If the proposal put forth in this paper can be confirmed either wholly or in part, it would have significant implications in terms of strategies aimed at minimizing the severity of COVID-19 in a clinical setting.",

To date, 12 million cases and over 550,000 deaths due to this disease have been reported worldwide [3] . Several researchers have observed a high degree of variation in the prevalence and mortality associated with COVID-19, both between widely separated countries [4] [5] [6] and within the same continent or country [7] [8] [9] . A variety of factors have been hypothesized to be responsible for this variability, including prior exposure to other respiratory coronaviruses [4] , demographic variations across or within countries [6, 9] , cultural factors that may influence disease transmission [6] , the enforcement of restrictive measures by local and federal governments and the level of trust of the general public in these measures [5] [6] [7] and genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 itself [10] . However, none of these hypotheses have been tested to date, and the evidence supporting some of them is inconsistent [6, 10] .",

Another group from India found evidence of fecal shedding of coronaviruses in 23% of a control group of healthy children, suggesting that asymptomatic infections with such organisms may also be common [25] . Besides these geographical variations, ethnic variations in the presence of antibodies to enteric coronaviruses have been described, with high levels being found in Australian Aboriginal children and low to undetectable levels in children of European origin [26] .

In the first, information on mortality rates for COVID-19 for the 50 countries reporting the highest number of cases was extracted from the Johns Hopkins Medical University interactive dashboard for COVID-19 [3] on July 1, 2020. The correlation between these parameters and World Health Organization statistics on disability-adjusted life years for diarrheal disease in the total population and in children under five years of age [36] was examined. Significant negative correlations were obtained between DALYs for all diarrheal disease and mortality rates (\u03c1 = \u22120.32, p = 0.023) and between DALYs for diarrheal disease in children under 5 and mortality rates (\u03c1 for mortality rate = \u22120.41, p = 0.003). It is noteworthy that a stronger relationship was noted in the case of childhood diarrheal disease. In the second analysis, government data on COVID-19 prevalence and mortality across twenty-four states in India [37] was correlated with information on DALYs for diarrheal disease for these states obtained from a multi-centre study [38] . A significant negative correlations was again noted between DALYs for diarrheal disease and COVID-19 mortality rates (\u03c1 = \u22120.5, p = 0.013) across states. Though these results are based on estimates of diarrheal disease as a whole rather than on measures of intestinal infection with coronaviruses, they provide indirect support of a link between prior intestinal infections, particularly in childhood, and a reduced impact of COVID-19 at the international and national levels.",

First, the possibility of active intestinal replication of SARS-CoV-2 must be confirmed in vivo, preferably in prospective samples of confirmed cases, using methods such as tissue biopsies where this is ethically and clinically feasible. Second, the link between intestinal replication of the virus, local inflammation, immune dysfunction and distal effects on other organs, such as the lung and kidney, can be verified by correlating such findings with alterations in markers of immune and inflammatory function, as well as with clinical, radiological and laboratory evidence of end-organ dysfunction. Third, surveillance studies in uninfected patients could be carried out to assess the frequency of symptomatic or asymptomatic intestinal infection with coronaviruses in different geographical relations, as well as the prevalence of antibodies to these viruses in different regions and at specific ages. The results of these studies could then be correlated with measures of regional and cross-national variations in the clinical severity and outcomes of COVID-19, which would include not only mortality but other adverse outcomes such as multiple organ dysfunction or the need for assisted ventilation. Fourth, in vitro or animal models could be used to test the effect of prior intestinal infection with coronaviruses on the morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. Finally, if a significant effect of prior intestinal coronavirus infection can be demonstrated using the above methods, its relative magnitude and its interaction with other factorssuch as the demographic and social factors discussed earliercould be quantified in prospective samples across distinct geographical locations.",

The first of these points probably reflects methodological limitations in earlier research: more advanced techniques, such as immunofluorescence, have confirmed the presence of coronaviruses in stool samples of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms [41] .
