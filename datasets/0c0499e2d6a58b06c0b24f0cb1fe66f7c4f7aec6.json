Using data at the community-level in Chicago, this work aims to advance our understanding on how public interventions affected criminal activities at a finer spatial scale. The analysis relies on a two-step methodology. First, it estimates the community-wise causal impact of social distancing and shelter-in-place policies adopted in Chicago via Structural Bayesian Time-Series across four crime categories (i.e., burglary, assault, narcotics-related offenses, and robbery). Once the models detected the direction, magnitude and significance of the trend changes, Firth's Logistic Regression is used to investigate the factors associated to the statistically significant crime reduction found in the first step of the analyses. Statistical results first show that changes in crime trends differ across communities and crime types. This suggests that beyond the results of aggregate models lies a complex picture characterized by diverging patterns. Second, regression models provide mixed findings regarding the correlates associated with significant crime reduction: several relations have opposite directions across crimes with population being the only factor that is stably and positively associated with significant crime reduction.",

In particular, at the behest of public health officials, citizens of just about every country have been subject to social distancing measures, stay-at-home policies, shelter-inplace designations, and many were forced to remain in their homes for well over a month at a time in order to contain the spread of the virus.",

The diffusion of COVID-19 through February and early March of 2020, forced Illinois Governor Pritzker to first announce a disaster proclamation (i.e., a state of emergency) and subsequently issue official restrictive interventions to contain the diffusion of the virus. The first measures, such as school closures, were promulgated on March 13th, but it is with the set of interventions on March 15th that the State government started a series of escalating measures aimed at enforcing social distancing between citizens, such as the closure of bars and restaurants and the cancellation of all gatherings involving 50 or more people. On March 20th, the State government also issued a stay-at-home-order, closing all non-essential businesses. The stay-at-home order, which originally had to be in place until April 7th, was firstly extended for the entire State of Illinois until April 30th and, secondly, through May 29th.",

Decades of research in crime and delinquency have demonstrated that crime does not occur randomly across space and time (Freeman et al. 1996; Johnson 2010; Weisburd 2015) . Events are rather clustered and follow specific patterns based on social, economic, demographic and ecological characteristics of the environment (Merton 1938; Shaw and McKay 1942; Gibbs and Erickson 1976; Blau and Blau 1982; Sampson and Lauritsen 1994; Papachristos et al. 2011; Damm and Dustmann 2014; Weisburd 2015) . The existence of such differences opens new lines of inquiry in the attempt to frame the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on criminal phenomena. Accordingly, the current study attempts to disentangle meso-level dynamics focusing on Chicago's communities, seeking to test whether changes in crime trends are consistent and similar across very different areas and, eventually, explore the main correlates associated with the actual presence of statistically significant reduction in daily-based crime counts.",

Scholars have thus been interested in scrutinizing whether the modifications in human daily habits generated by the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in consequent changes in criminal activity. While Routine Activity Theory and Crime Pattern Theory point in the direction of a general crime reduction, especially for thefts, robberies, burglaries, and homicides, General Strain Theory goes in a different direction. In a situation of limited freedom of movement, increased social isolation, financial distress, and uncertainty related to the aforementioned containment policies and the risk of economic backlashes, individuals may be subjected to negative stimuli (e.g., stress) that could lead them to experience a range of negative emotions which, left unchecked, may lead to the commission of a crime. In light of this, while interaction and movement reduction can affect crime in the short-term, the prolonged stay-athome order may trigger spikes in certain types of crimes in the medium-and long-ranges.",

Three sets of reasons lie behind the choice of these four crime categories. Firstly, these crimes (with the exception of narcotics) have been analyzed by recent studies focusing on the impact of COVID-19 on crime. Our study would thus provide further insights on crime typologies that have been investigated only at aggregate level. Second, these crime categories are distinct in nature, hence allowing us to observe not only differences at spatio-temporal levels but also crime-wise. Burglaries, for instance, are appropriative and are not mandatorily \"physical\", per se. Contrarily, assaults, robberies and most of narcoticsrelated offenses require interaction between individuals. Furthermore, robberies and assaults are mostly characterized by a certain degree of violence. Also, while burglaries and robberies map appropriative offenses, assaults have a rather expressive nature and are generally motivated by different objectives or reasons. Finally, narcotics-related offenses are connected to the provision of an illegal service, that can be regulated by complex criminal markets. At the same time, narcotics are also associated with policing activities. Thanks to these characteristics, narcotics allow for analyzing additional dynamics that possibly emerge as consequence of the anti-COVID-19 measures. Thirdly, these four crime categories account for a total of more than 122,000 reported crimes registered in the Chicago Crime Database from January 1st 2018 to May 17th 2020, 1 thus ensuring a sufficient number of crimes to carry out reliable analyses.",

In the first part, we evaluate the impact of social distancing in Chicago, specifically focusing on burglaries, assaults, narcotics-related crimes, robberies across all of the 77 urban communities that are part of the city through the use of Bayesian Structural Time Series (Brodersen et al. 2015) , partially replicating the methodology presented in Campedelli et al. (2020) . Within the context of the Bayesian models, we focus on the distribution, direction, and significance of the relative cumulative effect (RCE) of COVID-19 containment policies for each crime in each community. The RCE captures the relative difference (rather than the crude count) between the actual number of crimes that occurred in the post-intervention period (which goes from March 16th to May 17th) and the predicted number of crimes that we would have expected in absence of any intervention, as computed by the simulation model. This first part of the methodology allows for understanding whether changes in crime trends (either positive or negative) exist and what their distribution across Chicago communities is. The models are coded in R (R Core Team 2013) and performed using the Causal-Impact package (Brodersen et al. 2015) .",

The rationale behind the inclusion of these variables lies in the need for understanding whether significant crime reductions are driven by crime rates in the past. From a theoretical point of view, it is relevant to understand whether the most evident positive effects (i.e., crime reductions) are observed regardless of the pre-lockdown levels of criminal activity or if, contrarily, there exist patterns highlighting greater benefits experienced by areas generally known for their high crime presence. Furthermore, a measure mapping neighborhood safety is considered to investigate how individual self-perception is reflected in the criminal changes that occurred during the lockdown. Neighborhood Safety is in fact a measure gathered from the Healthy Chicago Survey [provided by the Chicago Department of Public Health (2020)], which estimates the rate of adults aged 18 years and older who report to feel safe all of the time and most of the time in a given community. The rate is weighted to reproduce the population from which the sample is drawn. In line with our reasoning regarding crime rates, we are interesting in verifying whether communities that are perceived as less safe have benefited more from the COVID-19 containment policies. Finally, the dimension also controls for the presence of a police station within the community, as to contribute to the existing debate on the effects of police presence on crime trends (Wilson and Boland 1978; Di Tella and Schargrodsky 2004; Ratcliffe and Breen 2011) .",

The criminological and economic literature has widely investigated the variability in crime between urban and non-urban/rural contexts, and one of the characterizing elements of urban contexts is the higher number (and density) of inhabitants. Urbanization is positively associated to criminal activity (Flango and Sherbenou 1976; Larson and Garrett 1996; Glaeser and Sacerdote 1999) , but within the context of a pandemic-driven lockdown, the criminal opportunities related to the dynamic aspects of urban life [such as transient crowding, see Jarrell and Howsen (1990) ] may be consistently reduced, thus thinning the role of urbanization-and population-in driving criminal activity. Furthermore, in line with routine activity theory (Cohen and Felson 1979) , highly populated areas may have developed a higher level of formal and informal guardianship and control, thus further minimizing criminal opportunities. Secondly and thirdly, income diversity and poverty are considered. Income inequality and poverty at the community level may be associated with the experience of status and monetary strain, which, in turn may contribute to generate anger and frustration (Agnew 1999) . Research has gone beyond the borders of relative and absolute deprivation to investigate the interplay between the two concepts, finding mixed results that generally vary across units of analyses (e.g., countries, regions, cities, communities) and crime types (Patterson 1991; Hooghe et al. 2011; Pare and Felson 2014; Burraston et al. 2018) . In light of the complex relationship between income inequality and poverty, this study will test whether we can identify associations between the two and the significant reduction of crimes in Chicago communities.",

Specifically, it might happen that reductions in one crime type in a certain area is followed by increases of other crimes in the same environment. Within the exceptional context of the lockdown, we may expect different crimes to follow common trends, due to a diffused reduction in criminal opportunities.

The following maps show, for each crime, the presence of a significant change in the daily trend (top subfigures), along with the magnitude of the cumulative RCE (bottom subfigures). Figure 2 refers to the community-wide analysis of burglaries. It is straightforward to notice that the vast majority of communities did not experience any significant change (i.e., red-colored communities). The bottom pictures the distribution of the RCE magnitude per each community (lighter colors are associated with stronger negative RCE values-i.e., crime reductionwhile darker are linked to higher positive RCE-i.e., crime increase). The map on the right indicates that there is a relevant share of communities (n = 12) that experienced an increase, even up to CRE = 2.19 (i.e., an increase of 219% compared to the forecasted cumulative number of crimes as estimated by the counterfactual scenario with no issued interventions produced by the Bayesian model), although only 2 of these increases were found to be significant. The two communities that experienced a significant increase in crime are Douglas and Hyde Park, situated in the South Side district. Among the sociostructural factors that cause opposite trends in burglaries, different distributions of residential and non-residential buildings may play a role, as COVID-19 containment policies may impact residential and non-residential burglaries to different extents (Ashby 2020) . Figure 3 assesses the changes and RCE distribution for assaults. Compared to burglaries, a higher number of communities experienced significant changes, although within a smaller RCE range (the lowest being an RCE = \u2212 0.75). These communities are mostly clustered in the Central, Southwest, and South Side districts. It is worth noting that the literature has shown that the former two districts were generally associated with high to very high levels of crime (Papachristos 2013; Schnell et al. 2017) . Nine communities display a b The community-level situation in terms of narcoticsrelated crimes is displayed in Fig. 4 . Overall, almost every community experienced a negative RCE: 45.54% (35 out of 77) of the communities displayed statistically significant reductions in narcotics-related offenses. Most of the communities experiencing significant crime reduction are those that were generally characterized by high levels of crime in the pre-policy period (Schnell et al. 2017) , and they are clustered in the West Side, Southwest Side, Far Southeast Side districts. Only 2 out of 77 communities witnessed an increase, but none are significant.",

For each crime, Table 3 shows the effects of the crimerelated correlates described above. The presence of a significant reduction in burglaries is not predicted by any of the included correlates; not even the rate of burglaries that occurred in 2019 is associated with a decrease in the post-intervention period. Conversely, effects are found for other crimes. The rate of assaults computed for 2019 is positively associated with a statistically significant reduction of assaults in the post-intervention period (OR = 1.008, p < 0.1). The same pattern is found for robberies: the higher the rate of robberies in 2019, the higher the likelihood of a significant reduction after the introduction of the containment policies (OR = 1.020, p < 0.1).",

Specifically, the relationship indicates that the higher the perceived safety in a neighborhood the lower the odds of reduction in narcoticsrelated offenses. This finding might be related to policing dynamics: police may decide to target communities that are generally less safe, hence reducing the possibility to positively influence narcotics activity in safer areas. Conversely, safer neighborhoods have higher odds to experience reductions in assaults (OR = 1.040, p < 0.1). This finding may be explained by the fact that social distancing and shelter-in-place policies further reduce the opportunity for assaults in already safe communities by sensibly reducing the number of potential victims in the streets. Lastly, the presence of a police station within a community does not have any significant impact on crime reductions. 5 While the magnitude of the OR is mostly positive (and high), except for burglaries, the statistical Since data on police stations were gathered with their associated ZIP codes, and since a ZIP code may belong to more than one community in the city of Chicago, a community was labeled as \"has police\" if there was at least one police station present in a census associated to the community. If, for instance, community A and B share ZIP code y, and ZIP code y has a police station, both A and B are labeled as \"has police\" communities. relationship is not strong enough to make any inference about the deterrence role of police stations in the postintervention timeframe. Table 4 focuses on the socio-economic variables. Two relations are found concerning the significant reduction of burglaries. First, more populated communities are more prone to experience significant reductions. The positive relation between significant crime reduction and population is found for all the considered crimes (burglary OR = 1.039, assault OR = 1.039, narcotics OR = 1.032, robbery OR = 1.056). In fact, the computation of the average marginal effect shows that burglaries are expected to reduce by 3.8% (OR = 1.039) when the population of the average community increases by 1 unit (an increase of 1,000 inhabitants), and other factors are held constant at their mean. Still, the actual effects can be relevant given that communities in Chicago are heterogeneous in terms of population (the minimum is 2,254 and the maximum is 100,470 with a standard deviation of 22,916.61). We interpret the overall effect of population in the frame of Routine Activity Theory: more inhabitants forced at home enhance guardianship, reducing crime opportunities (Cohen and Felson 1979) .",

More in general, evidence pointing in the direction of increases in crime-although circumscribed to few communities and few crimes-suggests further research aiming at explaining them should be conducted.",

The 2019 level of assaults was positively associated with the statistical reduction of the same reference crime category. The same applies to robberies. This suggests that communities that had previously high levels of such offenses benefited more from the COVID-19 containment policies, compared to other communities. Concerning perceived neighborhood safety, two opposite relationships were found. Higher perceived safety in a community predicts significant reductions in assaults, while a contrary link was found for narcotics, possibly due to policing dynamics. Finally, the presence of a police station located in the ZIP codes that are part of a community did not lead to any significant association with crime reduction.",

Also surprisingly, vacant housing rate was positively associated with significant reductions in narcotics. Income diversity was positively associated with reductions in narcoticsrelated offenses and assaults but negatively associated with a decline in burglaries and assaults. This latter result may be linked to the role of relative deprivation in shaping criminal activity within economically heterogeneous communities (Blau and Blau 1982) . In parallel, poverty is negatively associated with reductions in burglaries suggesting that absolute deprivation, in general, has a negative impact-especially in such an exceptional Table 6 Firth's logistic regression model for other crimes evolution (D.V. is \"Presence of significant crime reduction\"-CR = 1) ****Significant at 99.9%, ***Significant at 99%, **Significant at 95%, *Significant at 90%",

The number of inhabitants is the only variable positively associated with all the considered crime types, indicating that the higher the number of people at home, the higher the levels of capable guardianship, the lower the opportunities for crime. Indications also emerged from the analysis of healthrelated and demographic variables. First, the higher the share of people aged more than 65 years old, the lower the odds of observing a statistically significant reduction of burglaries. This can be related to the fact that burglars prefer to target people that pose weaker resistance and guardianship to their residencies and that retired people tend to spend more time at home than younger ones; therefore, containment policies might introduce smaller changes in the communities where older people are more numerous. Furthermore, the higher the number of people aged less than 18, the higher the levels of assaults, in line with perspectives on life-course criminology and with the hypothesis that youth are less prone to comply with rules and restrictions.",

We framed our work in the context of Routine Activity Theory (Cohen and Felson 1979) , Crime Pattern Theory (Brantingham and Brantingham 1984) and General Strain Theory (Agnew 1992 (Agnew , 1999 ), but the community-level focus of the analyses are motivated by the literature on crime concentration which indicates that crime does not occur randomly in time and space (Shaw and McKay 1942; Freeman et al. 1996; Johnson 2010; Weisburd 2015) . It rather clusters in certain areas of a city. Concerning our crimes of interest, Routine Activity Theory and Crime Pattern Theory both point in the direction of diffused decrease in crime events due to the massive reduction in opportunities (a joint effect of increased capable guardianship and very low human mobility). On the other hand, General Strain Theory suggests that the presence of negative stimulisuch as the stress associated to isolation and financial and economic uncertainty-and the impossibility to reach positively valued goals due to the stay-at-home policies may lead to crime by increasing negative emotions responses, thus predicting potential spikes in certain types of offenses. As these propositions govern the overall dynamics concerning crime, we posited that such theories can explain the extent to which criminal activity varies across Chicago communities due to their different criminal, social, economic, health, and demographic contexts. Indeed, certain areas of the city experienced crime reduction, while others did not. These reductions are crime-sensitive and depend on the different contextual characteristics of the communities.",

First, there is a well-known gap between actual and reported crimes. It is thus important to be careful when interpreting inferential results that are solely based on reported events. In addition, crimes can also be reported later compared to the day when they were actually committed. To partially mitigate possible biases coming from short-term late reporting we collected the data on June 6th 2020-three weeks after May 17th 2020 which is the last day of our time frame. Nonetheless, this does not help to solve problems related to long-term late reporting. Further, the literature on crime and place has consistently shown that crime is patterned at micro-levels. This means that going more in detail at the geographical level may reveal further mechanics and patterns that our analyses fail to detect and consider. Community-wide analyses already disentangle diverging dynamics, but Chicago's communities are highly complex, multifaceted, and diverse, and it is thus likely that more micro approaches would be useful in highlighting further dynamics. Thirdly, we only considered a small set of crimes and some aggregate crime categories (i.e, burglary does not distinguish between residential and non-residential crimes). Given the heterogeneity of the results we provided, we expect many more layers of complexity intervening in all the other offenses that we have not considered. Future work should address this gap.",

This finding prompts new research questions and provides relevant insights also from a policy standpoint. The inhomogeneous distribution and magnitude of effects and the statistical associations found with variables mapping the context of each Chicago community can help inform public policies and police practices aimed at preventing and tackling crime in this exceptional situation.
