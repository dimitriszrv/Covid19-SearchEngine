There were logical reasons for the decision, such as improving health infrastructure and delaying community spread of the virus. Essential activities were announced and nonessential canceled. These measures were welcome by the citizens for the first 2 months, and President AF's approval was high. Since then, social fatigue, lack of income, sense of uncertainty, and an inevitable increase in the infection rate and death toll led many to question government mandates related to COVID-19. Now, 6 months later, schools, research facilities, and universities are still closed, interurban buses and commercial flights never circulated, people can only go to the banks with an appointment, numerous small and large business are broke, the unemployment rate has climbed up, real salary and pensions cannot match up the rise in inflation, and the U.S. dollar exchange rate is increasing permanently in an informal market, while the Central Bank keeps losing its reserves. The government does not seem to have an economic and development program in progress; besides a productive dialogue between officialism and opposition about the real needs of the society does not exist. This situation is increasing social restlessness and deepens the fracture of Argentine society.",

A detailed report from Argentine Beef Promotion Institute (IPCVA, 2020) indicated that the volume of beef production for the second quarter of 2020 shows an interannual expansion of 7.3% compared with the same period in 2019. In the first 5 months of 2020, more than 25% for the beef demand was from China but, in June, it fell below 20%; this makes it difficult to predict exports volume.

When affordable, consumers prefer beef over other meats. In Figure 1 , we can observe a decrease in beef consumption per capita for the first semester of 2020. This can be attributed to an increase in retail prices, low incomes, and job loss, undoubtedly aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Retail prices, as of June 2020, grew at a yearon-year rate of 52.6%, significantly above the general inflation rate of around 42.8%. Still, 74% of the beef produced supplies the domestic market, and the remaining 26% go to exports (IPCVA, 2020). Argentina's total exports for the first semester of 2020 reached 27.336 million USD, with a great collapse in the interannual variation of the oil-petrochemical and automotive sectors, among others (INDEC, 2020b). However, exports in U.S. dollars for the main agribusiness sector (soybeans, corn, and wheat), with a proportional participation of 21.5%, showed a positive interannual variation. Beef and leather made up a significant 5.9% share of U.S. dollars income. Despite the increase in metric tons (MT) exported compared to 2019, in US dollars, beef had a low interannual variation of \u22123.9% probably because international prices plunged 23%.",

Although, in Argentina, there is about 15 million head of sheep, their meat consumption is negligible; some estimates indicate only about 1 kg per capita annually. Poultry and pork production and domestic market consumption average across 2017-2019 and the first semester of 2020 (MAGYP, 2020c,d) are shown in Figure 2 . Reported interannual variation (January-July, 2019-2020) indicates that production was +2.3% and +5.5%, consumption +2.9% and \u22121.3%, and exports \u22121.3% and +66% for poultry and pork meat, respectively. It looks like the increase in poultry meat accounted for the decrease in beef consumption. The dramatic increase in exports from the pork industry was mainly because of Chinese demands, but the increase also shows the growth of this industry in Argentina. Currently, the African Swine Fever outbreak in Europe is an unfortunate fact; nevertheless, it can open a new business opportunity for the Argentine pork industry. Consequently, up to date, COVID-19 restrictions do not seem to affect the variables presented here for the poultry and pork industry.",
