Methods: We performed an observational, prospective, interventional study including 65 COVID-19 unit personnel. On a total of 196 serum samples (at least 2 serum samples for each HW), LFA and ELISA tests for SARS-COV-2 IgG and IgM were performed. Also, 32 serum samples of SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive patients at least 21 days before sampling, and 30 serum samples of patients obtained up to November 2019, before COVID-19 outbreak in China, were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Findings: Of the 65 HWs enrolled, 6 were positive in LFA; overall, of the 196 serum samples, 20 were positive in LFA. All ELISA tests performed on serum samples collected from HWs were negative. The specificity of LFAs was 90.77% considering the 65 HWs and 89.80% considering all the 196 health workers serum samples analyzed. Considering the data on HWs, ELISA test for SARS-COV-2 antibodies showed a specificity of 100%, including all the 196 serum samples collected, and 100% including the 65 HWs. The ELISA and LFAs performed after 21 days last COVID-19 patient was discharged were all negative. Conclusion: LFAs compared to ELISA tests result in less specificity, considering COVID-19 negative personnel and patients. Thus, LFAs seem to be not adequate in the active surveillance of HWs.",

Clinical passive surveillance with self-assessment for fever or other suggestive symptoms for COVID-19 is recommended for all exposed HWs. However, this strategy may lack information from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic subjects. For this reason, it is of utmost importance that all HWs undergo, in addition to clinical passive surveillance, microbiological active surveillance with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) or serological tests.",

Point-of-care lateral flow assays (LFAs) automated chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) and enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are the most widely used commercial tests. Rapid IgM/IgG tests by LFAs can be efficiently used in the surveillance of HWs since they are inexpensive and simple tests giving results in 10-15 minutes, thus particularly suitable to population scale diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in both high-income countries and low-and middle-income countries. 9 The aim of the present study was to assess the diagnostic performance of two serological assays, in particular of an LFAs compared with an ELISA test in a cohort of HWs in a COVID-19 unit of a teaching hospital in southern Italy.",

The WHO published interim guidance on \"Risk assessment and management of exposure of health workers in the context of COVID-19\", defining high and low risk depending on exposure. 11 HWs exposed to a high-risk infection should stop all healthcare interaction with patients and get tested for COVID-19, should stay in quarantine and daily self-monitor temperature and respiratory symptoms for 14 days after the last day of exposure to a COVID-19 patient. HWs considered at a low risk should self-monitor temperature and respiratory symptoms daily for 14 days after the last day of exposure to a COVID-19 patient. 11 However, various strategies of screening HWs have been put in place including active and passive surveillance. 12, 13 Considering active surveillance, various strategies have been used, based on NAAT or serological surveillance or both in order to reduce the limits of each test. Widely is the low sensitivity of serological tests in the early phase of infection, 2,12-17 due to the natural antibody dynamic with 100% positivity for IgG after 17-19 days from infection. 18 This delay can be limiting in a setting of HWs constantly exposed to SARS-CoV-2, hospital outbreaks. NAAT is one of the most expensive tests on the market, with the need for expert staff and adequate facilities, which limit its use in screening, making the serological test a preference especially in some population settings.",

To our knowledge, this study is the first study that compared the diagnostic performance of LFAs with ELISA tests in a large cohort of HWs in a COVID-19 unit. In our cohort of HWs the specificity of LFAs was lower than that identified for the ELISA test (89.80% vs 100%); including also the patients admitted to our hospital before the outbreak in China, the specificity was 89.30% for LFAs and 100% for the ELISA test. Moreover, considering the patients hospitalized in our COVID-unit, the sensitivity was lower in LFAs compared with that identified for ELISA (90.65% vs 96.88%). The low specificity of LFAs leaves a margin of doubt regarding the infection until the results of NAAT, creating difficulties in work organization and also psychological and social problems. The limitation 17 Ong et al, including patients presenting at a teaching hospital with respiratory symptoms, showed a very heterogeneous sensitivity using 5 different LFA kits, ranging from 2/20 (10%) to 11/20 (55%); after choosing the most sensitive LFA they tested 228 patients and showed a sensitivity of 43% and a specificity of 98%. 2 Although there was a variation in performance characteristics, antibody testing with LFAs offers an additional value for estimating infection rate among HWs in resource-limited countries where PCR or ELISA are not readily available. Indeed, the main benefit of LFAs is the availability of real-time results and the advantage of being easily repeatable making them potentially useful in hospital setting for HWs surveillance.",
