We present the case of a patient recently discharged, after admission with confirmed COVID-19, who developed a pulmonary embolism and thrombosis of a biological mitral valve prosthesis, producing valve obstruction and stenosis. After 15 days of anticoagulant treatment, resolution of the thrombus and normalization of prosthetic valve function was observed. This case supports current recommendations of administering full-dose anticoagulation therapy to COVID-19 patients with biological heart valve prosthesis, even after the acute phase of infection. the case of a 77-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital during recovery from COVID-19 infection, with the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and severe prosthetic mitral valve stenosis. The patient had undergone mitral valve replacement with a biological prosthesis in 2017 during the treatment for Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis with severe valve regurgitation. Follow-up transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) performed in November 2019 showed normal prosthesis function (transmitral gradient of 4 mmHg). He had been recently admitted to our center for COVID-19 pneumonia, without requiring intensive care and was discharged three weeks before the reported clinical episode. During the 12 days of his admission for COVID-19 the patient received anticoagulation at prophylactic doses (bemiparin 3500 IU / 24h) following the current guidelines used in our center. The patient presented to the Emergency Department reporting dyspnea on light physical exertion. Physical examination showed a blood pressure of 115/80 mmHg and oxygen saturation of 86%, crackles in both lung bases and bilateral lower limb edema. We performed a 12-lead ECG observing the presence of sinus tachycardia at 105 beats per minute. Chest radiography showed signs of pulmonary congestion with bilateral pleural effusion.

We started standard treatment for heart failure with intravenous diuretics and weight-adjusted anticoagulation using low-molecular-weight heparin as part of the treatment for PE.

This seems to be due to a hypercoagulable state promoted by COVID-19, whose mechanisms have not yet been explained. As far as we know, this may happenas a consequence of endothelial damage secondary to direct viral injury as well as to systemic inflammatory response, where the complement system plays an important role 2 . Recently, some reported cases have been published, in which PE occurred despite the administration of anticoagulation treatment at prophylactic doses 3 . Furthermore, in most cases the thromboembolic event occurred after the acute phase of infection, namely in the recovery phase 4 . Therefore, the use of anticoagulation as primary prevention has been proposed despite limited evidence. However, some scientific societies have already made some recommendations about the anticoagulation management 5 , including the administration of anticoagulant therapy up to 45 days after hospital discharge if there are thrombotic risk factors (i.e. reduced mobility, active cancer, elevated D-dimer >2 times the upper limit of normal) and low risk of bleeding.",
