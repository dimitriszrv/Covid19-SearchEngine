Their mechanisms are discussed here. Viral toll-like receptor (TLR7) of COVID-19 is responsible to trigger hydrogen peroxide generation within the alveolar macrophages via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen oxidase 2 (NOX2) activation which oxidizes Cys98 on TLR7. Such oxidation blocks receptor potential to conduct signals for type 1 interferon production. Nutraceuticals having potential to inhibit NOX2, superoxide generation or preventing oxidation of Cys98 in TLR7 have potential to evoke TLR7 mediated type 1 interferon production towards RNA virus infections including COVID-19. RNA virus infections have been shown to induce O-GlcNacylation of mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS) at multiple sites which prohibits its susceptibity for K63-linked ubiquitination and further interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation. Glucosamine supplementation has been investigated to upregulate MAVS to activate IRF3 in response to viral infections. Currently, vitamin C infusion is under clinical trial for the treatment of severe COVID-19 virus infected pneumonia as it plays important role in reducing inflammatory response and has antioxidant property.
