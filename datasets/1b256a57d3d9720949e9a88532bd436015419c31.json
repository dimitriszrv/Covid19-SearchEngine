            "text": "One of the principal measures adopted by many countries was a stay-at-home order, and the closed border (national lockdowns). In Peru, these were implemented from March 16 to June 30, 2020. People were only allowed to go out for essential activities, for instance, to buy food and medicine. However, due to the precarious labour market in Peru, where informal labour constitutes 50% of all labour (5) , and the existing pre-pandemic poverty, the purchasing power of Peruvian families was severely affected. The Peruvian government tried to help this vulnerable population by giving social aid (granting of money, early withdrawal from the private retirement pension and food donations) to face the stay-at-home orders' side effects. It has been suggested that this was not enough due to inefficient distribution and the critical situation exacerbated by COVID-19 pandemic. (6) It has been argued that stay-at-home orders could affect food insecurity due to the resulting economic crisis, massive loss of jobs, high food prices, and growing demand for medical care. (7) These results may generate adverse health effects in the short and medium term (7) . Recent research on the short-term impacts of stay-at-home orders supports this idea. One of the first studies in Peru reported a considerable income reduction after stay-at-home orders in 37% of the participants (8) and only in Lima-Peru, more than 2\u00b73 million Peruvians to lose their jobs (9) . Similar cases were reported in the US (10) and Bangladesh (11) . Higher food prices have been reported (12) as well as increased depression, anxiety and physical violence against women. (11) . Also, there have been reported changes in food choices and diets (13) .",

It is urgent to implement social protection policies that aim to strengthen real-time identification systems that focus on social assistance to the vulnerable population in the context of stay-at-home order (in which non-poor households can become a condition of poverty quickly). It is also essential to take advantage of these adverse scenarios to identify appropriate social aid strategies (money transfers, food donations, communal pots of food, etc.) according to the vulnerable population's characteristics and the pandemic state. These recommendations can help mitigate the adverse effects of stay-at-home order on food insecurity.",

            "text": "In Peru, 2014, the reported prevalence of MSFI was 29\u00b79% (35) ; however, our study found a prevalence of MSFI of 23\u00b72% in the first 30-45 days of stay-at-home order. Although these results are not comparable with MSFI initial values, the prevalence of MSFI found in this study may likely be underestimated because of some particular characteristics of the population under analysis (for instance, 73\u00b73% have a university education and only 12\u00b74% reported having monthly income less than 255 US$/month before the pandemic). Additionally, participants needed internet access and a social network account to access the survey, attributes that lowincome people generally do not have and that they are precisely the population most at risk of suffering food insecurity. (22, 26) Other studies that have evaluated Food Insecurity in the context of a COVID-19 pandemic using FIES have reported higher MSFI prevalence. For example, in Jordan, it was reported that the prevalence of MSFI was 59\u00b72% (36) , in Kenya and Uganda the MSFI increased from 50% to 88% and from 43% to 87%, respectively (15) . Our study measures individual MSFI. However, there is already evidence of the effect stay-at-home order on household MSFI. In Mexico, it was reported that the MSFI of the household increased from 24\u00b72% (2018) to 30\u00b72% (June 2020). (31) In Vermont-US also reported is an increase (from 18\u00b73% prepandemic to 24\u00b74%) of MSFI (14) and in rural Bangladesh in household whit women and their families the household MSFI increase from 8\u00b73% pre-pandemic to 51\u00b78% (May -June 2020). (11) Our study is one of the first investigations into MSFI executed within the stay-at-home order due to COVID-19 pandemic in Peru from March 16 to June 30, 2020. It was found that up to 40\u00b75% of participants experienced a considerable reduction in their income, the same result, were reported by the Young Lives study in Peru (June -July 2020) (37% of households were affected by a salary cut or suspension without payment). (8) These high percentages of income losses could be related to the fact that in Peru, 50% of income came from informal employment in the prepandemic period. (5) This could explain our results, i.e., those who had both reduced income (compared to high-income people) before the pandemic, and then less capacity to save money to face emergency situations and substantial income reduction during the pandemic, are shown to be more likely to have MSFI. These findings are consistent with other studies, for example, in Jordan (36) it was reported that people who had a monthly income per capita below the poverty line were more likely to have moderate food insecurity (OR: 5\u00b733; 95% CI: 4\u00b744-6\u00b740) and severe food insecurity (OR: 6\u00b787; 95% CI: 5\u00b7542-8\u00b7512). In the same way, other studies that explored the determinants of food insecurity in the pandemic contexts reported a higher risk to have MSFI in low-income people (37) , people who lost their job (14, 38) or people substantially lost their income (39) .",

In our study, we found that most respondents reported not having been part of this beneficiary population. For example, only 15\u00b77% received some type of support from the government to face the stay-athome order, and of the total of these only 25\u00b76% was allocated to people with pre-pandemic monthly income below the minimum living wage (less than 255 US$) and 55\u00b76% for people with monthly income from 256 to766 US$ (data not shown in tables). We do not have information on the percentage of the vulnerable population that did not receive government aid to face the stayat-home order in Peru. However, has been reported that the data source for targeting of vulnerable households living in poverty was designed for regular contexts and not allow the identification of families that abruptly entered poverty due to the measures of the mandatory stay-at-home order (5) , additionally, also was reported that there were problems in receiving money from social assistance, because nearly 14 million adult Peruvians (59\u00b78% of the total adult population) did not have an account in the financial system of banks. (40) For this reason, our results invite further analysis and discussion on the targeting and delivery of government social aid addressed the vulnerable population in a pandemic context.",

Ideally, we expected to have a sample with similar sociodemographic characteristics to the Peruvian national population (21\u00b72% and 20\u00b78% whit poorest quintile and poor quintile, respectively; with 28\u00b78% of the Peruvian population residing in the province of Metropolitan Lima and 71\u00b72% residing in other provinces or departments of Peru; with 60% of women between 15-49 years old having at least secondary level education and around 40% having higher education) (43, 44) . However, our sample was constituted mainly by women (74\u00b79%) and people who residing in the province of Lima Metropolitana (67\u00b77%); with only 12\u00b79% of those women have at least secondary level education, 87\u00b71% have higher education (data do not show in the table) and with 12\u00b74% of people with households with an average monthly income of less than 255 US$/month in pre-pandemic period (similar to the group of the poorest quintile). Considering these characteristics of the general Peruvian population and our study sample, we can mention that this study's sample has a similar distribution to Peruvian population that live in Lima Metropolitana, with high-medium sociodemographic level and it is not generalizable to the whole Peru. However, we showed significant evidence on MSFI in the context of the stay-at-home order due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",
