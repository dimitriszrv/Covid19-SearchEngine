            "text": "Communicating during a crisis can be challenging for public agencies as their communication ecology becomes increasingly complex while the need for fast and reliable public communication remains high. Using the lens of communication ecology, this study examines the online communication of national public health agencies during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, Sweden, and the United States. Based on content analysis of Twitter data (n = 856) and agency press releases (n = 95), this article investigates two main questions: (1) How, and to what extent, did national public health agencies coordinate their online communication with other agencies and organizations? (2) How was online communication from the agencies diversified in terms of targeting specific organizations and social groups? Our findings indicate that public health agencies relied heavily on internal scientific expertise and predominately coordinated their communication efforts with national government agencies. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that agencies in each country differed in how they diversify information; however, all agencies provided tailored information to at least some organizations and social groups. Across the three countries, information tailored for several vulnerable groups (e.g., pregnant women, people Crises can place responding organizations under extreme pressure. To address crisis situations, responding organizations engage in communication networks that encompass a wide range of actors (Kapucu, 2006) . Information in these networks flow in various directions: within and between organizations, as well as from organizations to the public and from the public to organizations (Quarantelli, 1997) . However, these information streams are not isolated from each other. They constitute multilevel, interdependent communication ecosystems (Walter et al., 2018) . The lens of communication ecology embraces this complexity, allowing researchers to explore the networks in communication ecosystems that individuals and organizations harness to reach their goals (Broad et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "Utilizing a communication ecology approach in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine how, and to what extent, national-level scientific public health agencies deliver their communication in a coordinated and collaborative fashion with other organizations, including governmental, nongovernmental, scientific, or international organizations. We also explore whether scientific public health agency messages target different organizations and social groups. Studying these questions is important for several reasons. First, the crisis communication landscape is crowded by multiple organizations and actors that compete for public attention and legitimacy (Hall & Wolf, 2019; Holmes et al., 2009) . Within this multivoice and information-rich environment, it is critical for responding organizations to collaborate with trusted partners for message delivery, in order to reduce information inconsistencies and cognitive stress in affected populations who receive conflicting messages (Hall & Wolf, 2019; Seeger, 2007) . In this respect, without specific efforts to coordinate the communication, functional fragmentation of government agencies may pose the risk of multiplying the type of information provided to the public (Zeemering, 2020). Second, studies have demonstrated that message redundancy (i.e., receiving the same message from different sources) increases the possibility that the information is absorbed and acted on in crisis contexts (Stephens et al., 2013) . Third, messages released in a coordinated and collaborative way avoid the creation of an information vacuum that may otherwise be filled by misinformation. Fourth, adequately tailored messages to different societal sectors or groups can promote an inclusive communication environment and address societal vulnerabilities that may place an undue burden (e.g., higher infection and death rates) on some social groups compared with others in the context of public health crises.",

At the same time, these platforms have facilitated the propagation of misinformation (Kouzy et al., 2020) and multiplied the number of actors and nonexpert and nonindependent opinions in the health-related information arena. As a result, engaging with other organizations and groups has become increasingly critical for government and public health agencies.",

Liu and Xu (2019) found that emergency management agencies engage most with peer government agencies, citizen groups, and media organizations.

Sweden kept most societal sectors open, but restricted public gatherings and introduced remote teaching in high schools and universities. In the United States, we examined the period 26 February 26 to May 26, 2020.

Similar patterns of online engagement behaviors were identified by previous literature (Liu & Xu, 2019; Sutton et al., 2015; Wukich & Mergel, 2015; Zeemering, 2020) in which government and emergency agencies proved to engage predominantly with other government organizations. This tendency of health agencies to partner mainly with internal departments or external trusted government partners in their communicative efforts may come at the expense of other organizations. Indeed, domestic NGOs were rarely included in the agencies' communication, implying that they were arguably not seen as relevant sources of information or collaboration partners. Johnson Avery and Kim (2009) noted a general tendency of health agencies such as the WHO and the CDC to make reference to governmental and public partners and exclude private sector organizations in their press releases. On the contrary, previous research and empirical evidence have suggested that NGOs have played a key role providing critical services to those in need during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially to socially vulnerable groups (Akingbola, 2020) . Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that engaging more frequently with NGOs may increase the health agencies' understanding of different social groups and help NGOs cater to vulnerable groups they serve.",

Although the COVID-19 outbreak originated in China, the country's authoritarian government disclosed limited information on the outbreak and how to mitigate it initially (Zhang et al., 2020) . Hence, Italy may have needed to draw expertise from international organizations, such as the WHO, which had extensive experience in responding to public health crises, such as the H1N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the Ebola outbreaks. Conversely, Sweden and the United States managed the pandemic in different ways: Sweden pursued a soft approach built on individual responsibility and voluntary recommendations, which was criticized by international actors (Giritli Nygren & Olofsson, 2020) .

            "text": "Regarding the information targets, some notable differences must be highlighted. Unlike the ISS and the CDC, the Swedish agency had a higher percentage of messages targeting different types of organizations. This might be explained by Sweden's decision to keep borders, schools (under the age of 16 years), and many businesses, including restaurants and bars, open and operational (instead of pursuing lockdown measures that were applied in Italy and parts of the United States) with the resulting need to maintain open communication channels with businesses and services. Some key organizations or services that had to remain fully operational during the peak of the pandemic, such as mass transit facilities, correctional services and grocery stores, were rarely targeted by communications from the health agencies in any of the countries. It is possible that the public health agencies assumed that individual responsibility weighs most in these contexts, especially in Sweden (Giritli Nygren & Olofsson, 2020) . The agencies might have considered that their agencies' charge did not go beyond communicating with the general public that use these organizations' facilities or services. Furthermore, public health agencies might have perceived these organizations as falling outside their area of responsibility or they might have established other communication channels with these organizations. Limited communication with these organizations might also be explained by negative social construction of population groups using these facilities (e.g., how low-income individuals and prisoners are portrayed in negative terms; Schneider & Ingram, 1993) .",

            "text": "The analysis also indicates clear differences in the degree to which social groups were targeted by the three agencies. Some differences (e.g., targeting of health care workers) may be explained by how the public health system in each country is structured. For example, in Sweden, the health care sector is managed on a regional level in collaboration with national government agencies other than the Public Health Agency of Sweden. Thus, guidelines for health care workers do not fall under the jurisdiction of the health agency. When targeting elderly people, considerations regarding the digital divide (i.e., technology use is less common in older vs. younger populations) may have affected agencies' online communication in Italy and the United States (Colombo et al., 2018) , the elderly social group was targeted at low rates in these communications. Conversely, in Sweden, 96% of people between the ages 65 and 74 years, and 77% of people between the ages 75 and 84 years, use the internet (Statistiska centralbyr\u00e5n, 2020). In addition, half of all people 70 years and older used the internet to retrieve information on the COVID-19 pandemic regularly, possibly resulting in a greater need to communicate with them through web-based tools (Gustavsson & Beckman, 2020) . Another explanation may be found in the Swedish strategy, which strongly focused on the protection of elderly people as a core vulnerable group, accompanied with repeated and specific recommendations for elderly people to self-isolate.",

            "text": "Despite these significant variations in the most targeted social groups, we found evidence for several commonalities across countries. Unsurprisingly, people with COVID-19 symptoms were targeted frequently by all agencies. More important, however, we found that the agencies did not often tailor information for groups such as pregnant women, people with disabilities, immigrants, and homeless populations. These groups are generally regarded as the particularly vulnerable in cases of a disaster or crisis (Tierney, 2014) , and studies have repeatedly highlighted the importance of their preparedness for public health emergencies (Andrulis et al., 2007) . This result echoes the findings by Sutton et al. (2020) , who analyzed Twitter communications by governmental public health agencies in the United States during the first 2 months of the pandemic noting the absence of hashtags specifically directed to at-risk groups. Tailored messages, as opposed to broad messages targeting the general public, are needed to reach different social groups, specifically in the context of health communication (Kreuter et al., 1999) . Public health agency communication strategies must provide vulnerable groups with relevant, adequate, and specific information; if vulnerable groups are excluded or not targeted, their capacity to prepare for and respond to crises may be negatively affected, ultimately exacerbating existing social inequalities. The studied agencies may have provided tailored information to vulnerable groups on other platforms; however, individuals from these groups would need to commit additional time and effort (e.g., active search in the webpages) to access such information.",

First, while agencies heavily rely on internal sources and external government agencies, other organizations (e.g., domestic NGOs) were underrepresented in all three cases. Given the essential role many NGOs fulfill during crises, interaction with these organizations may improve agency communication and create more inclusive communication ecosystems. Second, social groups that were rarely or never targeted in communication efforts belong to groups that have been previously identified as particularly vulnerable to disasters. It is crucial to provide them with tailored and adequate information to increase their access to relevant information and improve their coping capacities. Lack of tailored information for vulnerable groups indicates a need to adapt communication strategies and implement policies that focus on including vulnerable social groups more adequately in communication efforts.",
