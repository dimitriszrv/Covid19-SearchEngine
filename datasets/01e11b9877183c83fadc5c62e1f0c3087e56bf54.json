Currently, most German hospitals still have ample supplies of necessary equipment and medication, and intensive care unit (ICU) capacities are still abundant. The German government has therefore received some acclaim for their management of the disease. All medical specialties are affected in their routine-orthopedic and trauma departments had to adopt as well [12] . A number of organizational adjustments have been made in order to increase ICU capacity, allocate personal protective equipment (PPE), and personnel in anticipation of a rapid increase in hospitalization rates. In addition, the German government decided to postpone all elective surgeries, starting from 12 th March 2020 until further notice, adding to the economic and organizational burden on our profession. Resident surgeons have been allocated to ICUs and emergency departments to aid in the treatment of COVID-19 patients [13] . Orthopedic and trauma surgeons in private practice try to provide the best possible out-patient care, despite the oftentimes occurring lack of PPE and insufficient financial support. Though the German federal government passed a law on 25 th of March 2020 to lower the economic burden on hospitals and contract physicians in Germany, the true economic impact remains yet to be determined [14] .",

For the study, we designed a questionnaire in German language, containing a total of 50 items, grouped into 10 blocks; the questionnaire, as well as an English translation, are appended as supplementary material. The first 42 questions were designed to query certain dimensions of the pandemic impact, most of them contributing to one of six indices, namely \"Preparedness\", \"Resources\", \"Reduction\", \"Informedness\", \"Concern\", and \"Depletion\", as defined in supplementary material. These questions were defined \"index questions\". Within the survey, these questions were grouped thematically into blocks and both negative and positive wording was used. Questions regarding the different dimensions were mixed and usually spread over at least two blocks. The first two blocks with a total of 14 questions allowed \"does apply\", \"does not apply\", and \"neutral/unsure\" as answer and were mainly designed to enquire which protective measures had already been taken in the participant's institution. Block 3 asked for the level of reduction in in-patient and out-patient care (elective/ urgent cases), on a 5-degree scale in percent. Blocks 4 to 7 enquired the participants' level of agreement towards statements regarding preparations, handling, medical, and financial consequences of the pandemic and support by the orthopedic associations and the insurances. As answers, a five-point Likert scale was employed, consisting of \"fully agree\", \"rather agree\", \"neutral\", \"rather disagree\", and \"fully disagree\". The last three blocks consisted of \"profile questions\", multiple-choice questions regarding the professional and personal profile of the participant, including field of employment, speciality, position, size of the unit, affiliation, age, and gender, as well as an open text field for questions and comments directed at the professional associations in the end.",

The average of all answers within one index generated the final index result.

We conducted a correlation matrix analysis calculating Spearman's R, first among the index questions and the result of the calculated indices, then with the profile questions against each other and the indices (all in GraphPad Prism). Additionally, we performed a factor analysis including Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin's criteria (KMO) for sampling adequacy, to confirm the validity of our indices, and tested for co-linearity among the profile variables (both SPSS). Then we ran a bivariate analysis of multiple Mann-Whitney-U-tests for each dichotome profile variable against the six indices for significant differences between groups having \"yes\" (1) or \"no\" (0) in that profile variable and its effect size on each of the six indices. Last, data was analyzed in multiple stepwise regression, eliminating factors that missed significance from the predictive regression model, aiming to find causative rather than coincident correlations.",

Due to the rapid pandemic development, prior pilot testing has not been performed and the lack of psychometric assessment should be borne in mind. Since we conducted a nationwide survey, the regional differences of the spread of COVID-19 may lead to distortions in the assessment of the pandemic due to areas affected to varying extents. When the survey was conducted, the COVID-19 pandemic was still in its early stages and expected to further progress. Our survey is a first impression of the impact this pandemic has on orthopedic and trauma surgery in Germany. We encourage its use among other nations and other specialties, to generate comparable results. In order to assess the overall effects of the pandemic more accurately, there will be follow-up surveys.",

Particular support should be given to self-employed surgeons in coping with the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. We could show that the index \"concern\" had a strong negative correlation with the indices \"informedness\" and \"resources\", so in future handling of the crisis, information and resources are the key factors to diminish healthcare professionals' anxiety. The small but significant gender gap in overall concern should be taken into closer consideration for future crisis management in order to be able to react appropriately.",

Orthopedic and trauma surgeons in Germany advocate and support the measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The preliminary success in the fight against the pandemic in Germany demonstrates that the appropriate measures have been implemented. The existence of effective healthcare structures, especially well-equipped hospitals in terms of personnel and funding, have proven to be indispensable in a national and global health crisis. This should not be forgotten in the future, when discussions about cost-cutting measures and restructuring in the healthcare systems will resurface in Germany and worldwide.",
