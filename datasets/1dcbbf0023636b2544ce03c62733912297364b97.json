With regards to long-term consequences, biomarkers of physiological effects as well as the psychological experiences are of significant importance for comprehensively understanding the whole COVID-19 recovery period. The present research surveys the IgG antibody titers and the impact of COVID-19 as a traumatic experience in the aftermath of the active infection period, around two months after diagnosis, in a subset of COVID-19 patients from the first wave of the outbreak in Northern Cyprus. Associations of antibody titers and psychological survey measures with baseline characteristics and disease severity were explored, and correlations among various measures were evaluated. Of the 47 serology tests conducted for presence of IgG antibodies, 39 (83%) were positive. We identified trends demonstrating individuals experiencing severe or critical COVID-19 disease and/or those with comorbidities are more heavily impacted both physiologically and mentally, with higher IgG titers and negative psychological experience compared to those with milder disease and without comorbidities. We also observed that more than half of the COVID-19 cases had negative psychological experiences, being subjected to discrimination and verbal harassment/insult, by family/friends. In summary, as the first study co-evaluating immune response together with mental status, our findings suggest that further multidisciplinary research in larger sample populations as well as community intervention plans are needed to holistically address the physiological and psychological effects of COVID-19 among the cases in the long-term.",

It is essential to better understand the timeline of immune response including the appearance of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, their lifespan and whether they are protective, at least partially, against a second infection. Preliminary research shows that detectable IgG antibodies generally start appearing after the first week after symptom onset, reach a peak around two to three weeks, and stay at detectable blood levels at least for a duration of 2-3 months even in milder cases, similar to previous observations in other SARS infections (5) (6) (7) . Moreover, the psychological effects of having the infection are also complex. The risk of having severe COVID-19, the overall disease burden, along with many unknowns about its short-and long-term effects, increase the stigma attached to the infection and the related anxiety among the public, and make COVID-19 cases vulnerable to post-traumatic stress as well as targets for harassment and discrimination (8) . It is presumed that the period of complete physiological and psychological recovery from the infection depends on disease severity and other physiological and socioeconomic factors. However, given all the elaborate aspects of COVID-19 yet to be investigated and understood, the long-term multi-faceted recovery period is still far from being deciphered.",

As scarce research shows, these reactions can also be influenced by contextual factors such as a history of war, famine, and the size of the population. More specifically, while smaller nations might appear to have the upper hand in rapid enforcement of measures, contextual factors such as the increased connectivity of the individuals in smaller societies, or negative collective experiences of war and famine in the past might increase the prevalence of negative coping behaviours and stigma induced depression (9) .",

            "text": "A particular case in point is Northern Cyprus, governed by a state that remains internationally unrecognized, and hence, not included in the global epidemiological COVID-19 statistics. In the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Northern Cyprus, 108 cases were diagnosed between 10 March and 16 April 2020. The authorities responded promptly and lockdown was imposed on March 11 (9) effectively halting education and government offices, and all other services except those considered essential. In addition to the global scare about the pandemic, the small community setting in Northern Cyprus (an estimated total population of around 400,000) with a history of war and trauma (10) further caused an intensified disease stigma. On the one hand, panic engulfed the small nation and there was widespread stigma toward those who tested positive or considered high-risk for transmitting the disease, i.e. Turkish Cypriots living abroad, who were brought home and quarantined (11) . On the other hand, videos of individuals under duress as a result of being quarantined were widely circulated in the social media and the public reacted negatively (12). Similarly, those who were tested positive recounted psychological trauma as their names made public and have been targeted (13) . Therefore, there is sufficient grounds to assume that in addition to the physiological impact of the disease, those who tested positive for the COVID-19 have also experienced psychological distress during and after the active infection period. In fact, in an earlier study conducted in Wuhan (China), the prevalence of significant posttraumatic stress symptoms associated with COVID-19 was estimated as 96.2% among clinically stable COVID-19 cases at discharge from quarantine (14) . Taken together, these observations suggest that assessing the biological markers of physiological effects vis-\u00e0-vis negative psychological experiences of the COVID-19 cases is important for holistic management of COVID-19 patients from diagnosis to potentially complete physiological and psychological recovery.",

This observation confirms that IgG antibodies are still detectable in the blood in most COVID-19 cases around 2 months post-diagnosis. However, further studies are necessary to determine the neuralizing activity of these antibodies and whether they provide any immunity against a second infection. Moreover, severe/critical COVID-19 cases most of whom were older and/or with comorbidities had higher IgG titers, and also showed trends for the most impact mentally. Overall, we conclude that more specialized attention should be paid to this group for providing further monitoring and treatment post-discharge because of their higher healthcare needs related to comorbidities as well as the psychological impact in order to expedite the full recovery period after the infection.",

Worry was the most commonly expressed emotion among the five emotions queried, with 71% of respondents having felt it moderately or more. Based on the responses to the psychological survey about two months after diagnosis, we infer that most cases have not yet recovered from the mental impact of the disease. Participants experienced COVID-19 as a life-changing trauma, experienced negative emotions, perceived themselves as discriminated against and experienced anxiety due to anticipated stigma in the future. In addition to replicating previous research on the negative psychological consequences of being tested positive for an infectious disease and that pandemics have a lasting negative impact on mental health among the general population (24) (25) (26) , our findings also show that cases experienced anxiety as a result of anticipated stigma. This is a novel finding which reveals that pandemics like COVID-19 have long-term negative mental health effects. Future research could replicate and extend these findings via longitudinal designs.",

About half of the survey respondents reported being a more worried person due to the infection, and perceiving the infection as a turning point in their life. About one in four individuals also reported concern that their relationship with their workplace and family/friends will deteriorate due to infection. Hence, community resources for provision of psychological support to the COVID-19 cases post-discharge is very important to minimize the long-term impact of the disease and maintain mental health in these individuals. In Northern Cyprus, a number of organizations and universities have already taken action and set up psychological counseling hotlines, free for use by the public (9) . These initiatives are very important and need to be expanded throughout the counties, regions and globally. However, more tailored intervention programs are needed especially for COVID-19 cases to combine mental check-ups with regular health check-ups at regular intervals. About one in ten individuals thought they could still transmit the disease. This provides another example of importance of using up-to-date medical info about the disease, and the person's current status in providing tailored therapy to the person for getting over pre-conceived notions about fear of continuing disease in the individual.",

There may be some differences between individuals willing and unwilling to participate in the study, especially with respect to psychological endpoints. Actually, we observed lower participation rates in the study by cases from a rural region that was more severely impacted by the outbreak and had to go under a regional quarantine for an extended time. Disease stigma, continuing worry, suspicion and mistrust likely led to lower participation rates, and these factors are directly related to psychological endpoints studied here. To facilitate a more practical implementation in the field, it was not possible to use a consistent time point for evaluation of the outcomes of interest. Nevertheless, timing of blood draw and survey response showed limited variability around a two-month time point post-diagnosis, with median [IQR] and range time being 66 [63.5-73] and 50-86 days, respectively. There were possibly correlated responses for either or both endpoints as we allowed participation of multiple family or household members in the study. There were eight families that were represented in the study with 2-3 members each. Finally, compared to continuous IgG titer measures, categorical nature of the survey responses produced higher variability in calculated psychological process scores, and hence, lower statistical power in detecting any associations with baseline factors and disease severity.",

Severe/critical COVID-19 cases had higher blood IgG antibody levels as well as the highest long-term mental impact. Holistic and a more personalized approach is needed for post-discharge monitoring and treatment of COVID-19 cases, with a focus on older age, comorbidity status and disease severity.

Median [IQR] titer level among positives and negatives were 4.95 [3.79-6.09] and 0.61 [0.16-0.72], respectively. Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 2 display the distribution of IgG antibody titers by baseline characteristics and disease severity. The factor that had the most impact on IgG titer at a median follow-up of two months post-diagnosis was disease severity. Nine subjects who had severe/critical disease had median [IQR] IgG titer of 6.09 [5.88-6.24] versus 3.94 [1.70-5.52] reported for thirty-eight subjects with mild/moderate disease (Wilcoxon rank-sum test; p=0.001). Among the baseline factors, fever/history of fever reported at the time of diagnosis yielded median [IQR] IgG titer of 5.56 [4.11-6.20] versus 3.57 [1.47-5.13] reported for those without fever/history of fever (Wilcoxon ranksum test; p=0.01). Having a comorbidity also produced higher median [IQR] IgG titers of 5.52 [4.31-6.09] versus 3.87 [1.25-5.56] in those without a comorbidity (Wilcoxon rank-sum test; p=0.03). The distributions of IgG titers by cross-tabulation of baseline characteristics and disease severity are displayed in Supplementary Table 3. In the mild/moderate disease severity group, a significantly higher level of IgG titer was observed in individuals with comorbidities (median [IQR]: 5.02 [3.92-5.67]) compared to those without (median [IQR]: 3.43 [0.88-4.87]) (Wilcoxon rank-sum test; p=0.03).",
