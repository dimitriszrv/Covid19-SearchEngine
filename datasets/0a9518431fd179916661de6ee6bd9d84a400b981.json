This article aims to describe key features and the nature of asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The cohort consisted of six participants, three pairs, which were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during February 2020 on board the Diamond Princess. Of the six confirmed (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) cases, four were initially diagnosed in Japan and two upon their arrival to Israel. Duration of infection was between four days and up to 26 days. Of the six patients, three were completely asymptomatic and the others were paucisymptomatic. All five patients in whom a computerized tomography (CT) scan was performed had lung pathology. In one patient, infectivity was tested using cell culture and a cytopathic effect was demonstrated. A serology test was performed in three of the patients and all three had a positive immunoglobulin G (IgG) four to eight weeks after disease onset. This case series demonstrates that asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic patients may play a role in infection transmission by demonstrating probable transmission among asymptomatic spouses and by demonstrating a viable virus via a cell culture. Additionally, asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic patients can have lung pathology and developing IgG antibodies.",

            "text": "A study by Mizumoto, et al 6 showed a prevalence of 17.9% of asymptomatic cases on board the Princess Diamond cruise ship. They claim that there is still no evidence that asymptomatic patients play a role in transmission. The article demonstrates that asymptomatic infections may result in transmission, as suggested by the fact that the cases described occurred among three couples, in which it is presumed that one spouse infected the other. Furthermore, a viable virus was detected from an asymptomatic patient. This is also supported by the work by Arons, et al 7 which reports transmission from a presymptomatic patient. Moreover, the current results reflect an infectious process with some element of pathology, even if it does not lead to overt COVID-19 disease due to the demonstration of a pathological lung process in the CT scans. These observations add to accumulating data on the potential role of asymptomatic patients in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the dissemination of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant benefit of large-scale test trace and isolate programs in the prevention of disease spread.",
