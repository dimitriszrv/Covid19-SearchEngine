In December 2019, a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged, leading to a pandemic of an 78 acute respiratory syndrome in humans (1).

Therefore, understanding the factors that determine adherence to 89 TRBs is essential. While TRBs lessen both personal risk of acquiring COVID-19 and population level 90 rates of COVID-19, they may have detrimental impacts on people's health, especially their mental 91 health (7-9). Further, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health may vary between 92 groups in the general population due to pre-existing differences, including stresses of living in areas of and latterly recommended the wearing of face coverings when shopping for food or using public 106 transport (for the Scottish roadmap out of the lockdown see (13)).",

Indeed, 109 an early modelling study found that physical distancing measures can be effective in reducing the 110 progression of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, delaying the epidemic peak, and delaying a 111 potential secondary peak (15). In addition to direct social exposure to respiratory droplets, 112 is also thought to spread by contact with infected surfaces and subsequently touching the eyes, nose 113 or mouth (14) . Since face-touching is frequent and habitual (16), prevention of transmission focusses 114 on improving hand hygiene (17). Good hand hygiene means washing your hands frequently, using 115 soap and water, and for at least 20 seconds (18, 19) . Hand washing is advised every time one enters 116 a building, including entering one's home, when you blow your nose, sneeze or cough, and eat or 117 handle food (20). Hand washing has been shown to reduce the incidence of infectious diseases, 118 especially when hand washing is done correctly and at the correct times (21-23).",

First, CHARIS is underpinned by evidence-based 336 psychological theories and thus supports a cumulative approach to conceptual development and 337 evidence. CHARIS can draw on a large existing evidence base that informs the measures used, and 338 details how individual constructs are meaningfully related. Use of three universal theories of 339 behaviour avoids the much criticised 'cafeteria' style research that is not conducive to the 340 development of a cumulative approach to evidence building (54, 55). A cumulative approach is vital to 341 support our understanding of the behaviour of populations during a pandemic, which is crucial in 342 circumstances where changing behaviour is the only available route to halting the pandemic. Second, CHARIS will provide fast, real-time, information to support and inform decision 344 making for policy-makers, public health and service commissioners. Third, the weekly data collection, 345 enables fine-grained analyses of people's reactions to government directives and instructions as they 346 are happening. The repeated measurement over 14 waves makes it possible to directly assess the 347 impact of directives and advice from the government for TRBs, in contrast to previous retrospective 348 studies or studies applying hypothetical situations (56). Fourth, our study will start as the Government-349 imposed restrictions went in to Phase One post-lockdown. The restrictions began to be eased, and 350 more people are allowed to go back to their workplaces, and to start to meet with others outside of 351 their own households. The timing of the CHARIS study places it in the unique position to assess 352 (changing) adherence to TRBs, in response to potentially changing beliefs about the behaviours and 353 the illness, as the Scottish government implements new Phases to gradually lift the restrictions.",

However, 367 measuring behaviour by self-report is open to a number of sources of error, including memory errors 368 and social desirability bias. Social desirability to report adherence is likely, however we have mitigated 369 the impact of social desirability where possible by employing the introductory text from the medication 370 adherence reporting scale (45, 46) .

Previous research has shown that greater perceived 193 susceptibility, perceived severity of the illness as well as, perceived efficacy of behaviour, and selfefficacy of TRBs during previous infectious disease pandemics were associated with more avoidance (i.e., physical distancing) or preventive behaviour (i.e., hand washing) (42).
